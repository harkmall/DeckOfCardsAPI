# DeckOfCardsAPI

### //TODO
- [x] Implement Shuffle (Shuffle doesn't maintain shuffled state, every time you request the deck again, it will get reshuffled. Probably not good, will look into that later.)
- [x] Change Deck-Cards relationship to Siblings instead of Parent-Child
  - Once done, make it so there are only ever 52 Cards in the DB and just reference them from different Decks
- [x] Implement drawing cards
- [x] Implement Partial Deck
